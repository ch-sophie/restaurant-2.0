# Restaurant 2.0

### A PHP project
### Learning solo challenge
### Duration: 5 days

### The mission
Once upon a time you made a website for a restaurant franchise. Now and after hearing about the wonderful work you did the owner is calling you back to implement new features and improve the website.     

Sadly, he can only pay you for a week of work, which won’t be enough time to implement all his ideas. Hopefully, he’s ready to make compromises, you have to implement as much as you can in the given time.     

### Instructions
- take back the old project
- implement at least one new feature
- improve the design (if you have time)
- use whatever technology you want

### Features 
1. Back office     
2. Guest book     
3. Gallery     
4. Bonus: use only one page to manage messages, the guestbook and the gallery
5. Deployment     

Thank you for reading. :coffee:
